    <p class = "mid">
      Growing up I was always enfactuated with the depiction of Heaven and Hell and what it these worlds would look like. Based on all the tales we have heard about them. In this concept I wanted the audience to depict what they believe Heaven and Hell would look like, wether they side with the brighter angel or the deep red. I want the viewers to have a choice when looking at my piece in which they think is evil and good. Looks can be decieving but in not in all cases.
